## Installation

This steps will guide you through the installation process for the app:

# Set up

First, make sure the gems that are required are installed:

```
bundle
```
Next you will need to set up your local database:

```
rails db:setup
```
This creates a development and testing database. As well as migrating the migrations.

# Database seeding

If you require data for development there are included `csv` files that allow you to use dummy data.

Just run:

```
rails csv_load:all
```

This will run the rake import task and seed your database.

# Starting the app

First, you must start a local server:

```
rails server
```
or
```
rails s
```
With the local server running you can use the browser of your choice to visit http://localhost:3000
